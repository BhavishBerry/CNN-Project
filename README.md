# 🧠 CNN Image Classifier on Google Colab

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented in a Google Colab notebook for image classification tasks. This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on:

- Building a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Training the model on a dataset of images.
- Evaluating the model's performance.
- Demonstrating the workflow in a Google Colab environment.

## 📁 Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset of images suitable for classification tasks. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets within the notebook.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project:

1. Open the Colab notebook: [CNN Image Classifier](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LdouajhMzHEly5npqxNizPj3Z_f5B6O6?usp=sharing)
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Build the CNN model architecture.
   - Train the model.
   - Evaluate the model's performance.

## 🛠️ Requirements

The Colab environment comes pre-installed with the necessary libraries. However, if running locally, ensure you have:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install the requirements using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

📊 Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:

Convolutional layers with ReLU activation.

MaxPooling layers for downsampling.

Flatten layer to convert 2D features to 1D.

Dense layers for classification.

The architecture is designed to efficiently extract features and classify images into respective categories.

📈 Results
After training, the model achieves satisfactory accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating its capability to classify images effectively.
